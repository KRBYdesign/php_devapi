# My DevAPI

> [Kyle Beasley](mailto:kyle@lacoxconsulting.com) 

This is a custom built API written in PHP designed to help me as an IT person in my day to day operations. This api will facilitate my homerolled IT ticketing system, and some internally hosted sites that I and other members of the company can use.
